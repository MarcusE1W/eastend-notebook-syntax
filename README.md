# East End Notebook - syntax theme

This is the East end syntax theme - Notebook style

A light flowery theme. With notebook style.

The East End Notebook syntax is designed for the [East End UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/east-end-ui).

- The idea is to have, together with the UI theme a GUI that is easily readable on a notebook in many light conditions.

- The syntax theme is based on the [One Dark](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax) syntax.
It has the same additional highlight support for:
C, Cpp, C#, CSS, Elixir, gfm, Go, Java, Javascript, Json, PHP, Phyton and Ruby.

- The syntax theme supports additional style elements of the [language-markdown](https://atom.io/packages/language-markdown) package.

- The colors are inspired by the [Pear](https://github.com/Niishi/pear-syntax) syntax theme.
