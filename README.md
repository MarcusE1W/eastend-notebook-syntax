# East End - syntax theme

A light flowery theme.

The East End syntax is designed for the [East End UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/east-end-ui).

The idea is to have, together with the UI theme a GUI that is easily readable on a notebook in many light conditions.

The syntax theme is based on the [One Dark](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax) syntax.
It has the same additional highlight support for:
-  C,
-  Cpp,
-  C#,
-  CSS,
-  Elixir,
-  gfm,
-  Go,
-  Java,
-  Javascript,
-  Json,
-  PHP,
-  Phyton,
-  Ruby.

The syntax theme supports additional style elements of the [language-markdown](https://atom.io/packages/language-markdown) package.

The colors are inspired by the [Pear](https://github.com/Niishi/pear-syntax) syntax theme.
